Launching A Dashboard
=====================
A new Galyleo Dashboard can be launched from the JupyterLab launcher or from the File>New menu:

An existing dashboard is saved as a .gd.json file, and is denoted with the Galyleo star logo:

It can be opened in the usual way, with a double-click.

The Galyleo User Interface
==========================
The Galyleo User interface consists of three components: the top bar, the side bar, and the Halo and Context Menu.  We discuss each of these in turn.  The mission of the Top Bar is to switch between global modes (interacting and selecting) and added non-chart elements (shapes, images, and text) to the dashboard.  The Halo and Side Bar is where individual objects are positioned and configured: where shape and text properties are set, borders defined, and images chosen.  The  Halo   permits the copying, deletion, resizing, and rotation rotation,  of objects front-to-back.  The Context Menu, brought up by a right-click on the object, permits its reordering.
The Top Bar
-----------
The top bar controls are in the top left of the dashboard.  They are primarily used to choose between selection mode (when the user is designing the dashboard) and interaction mode (when the user is interacting with the dashboard, e.g, manipulating a slider).  The practical difference is that when the user is in interaction mode (the arrow is highlighted) a Halo appears over the clicked item and the sidebar is shown; when in interaction mode (the hand is selected) the object is manipulated on click.
When Text (the A) is selected, a user click brings up a text box.  When a shape is selected (one of Rectangle, Ellipse, Image, or Label) the appropriate shape is drawn in response to a user click.
The last item on the top bar is a lifesaver icon, which brings up a bug-report dialog
